/*
  Currently, this is a VERY basic breakdown of the evolution types.
  1. leveling:
    Refers to ANY evolution that requires a level-up to evolve, whether this is the only requirement or just one of them.
    e.g. leveling with high-friendship, leveling while holding an item, leveling near a specific rock etc.
  2. Stone:
    Refers to all stone evolutions (not mega evolutions)
  3. Trade:
    Refers to ANY trade dependent evolution, whether it be trading, or trading with an item.

  May need to make this more specific, but is currently out of scope.
